## Introduction
A system of equations is a collection of two or more equations with a same set of unknowns. In solving 
a system of equations, we try to find values for each of the unknowns that will satisfy every equation 
in the system. The equations in the system can be linear or non-linear. In this project, only systems of linear equations 
are considered. A system of n by m equations is an intersting topic in mathematics where there is many numerical 
methods that can resolve it.

These methods can be divided into two main categories:
1. Iterative methods: where the final solution of the equations is very close to the real solution 
with a small tolrence to be choosed.
2. Exact methods: this kind of methods leads to the excat solution.

These two methods are widely used and have proven their worth over time.

### Utility
In this project, I implemented two main methods: the jaccobi method which is very useful methods for 
solving a system of n equations and it is an iterative method. The other one is the Gaussien method known as "Gaussien Elimination", 
also it is very wide method used for this task and leads to the exact solution.

Also, this poject provides many operations on matrices:
* Mathematical operations (addition, substraction, multiplication)
* Determinant of a n by n matrix
* Inverse of a n by n matrix
* Cofactor of a n by n matrix

### Testing 
To test this calcutor, I used CodeBlocks on windows 10, and do not forget to install "windows.h" library 
for the graphics.


This project takes advantage of oriented objects in C++, it uses the classes, composition, inheritence and 
many other topics of this language.
